# ðŸ§¿ Unofficial Resonite API Documentation

Unofficial community-driven OpenAPI specification for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) API.

## Preview in development

Start a local server to preview the documentation using [Stoplight Elements](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/elements/d6a8ba3f3c186-stoplight-elements). This server does a live-reload when you make changes to yaml files. Sweet!

```
npm run preview
```

> [!TIP]
> The Resonite API server is not configured with CORS to allow all origins, so if you want to test the requests in the document, you will need to use a proxy or browser extension to unblock CORS restriction.
> [CORS Unblock](https://webextension.org/listing/access-control.html) is a one good choice.
